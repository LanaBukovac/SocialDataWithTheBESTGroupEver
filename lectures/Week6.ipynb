    "Last week we had an intro to machine learning and regression and this week we continue with some more ML but focusing on classification instead. There are lots of courses on machine learning at DTU. And across many research areas, people use ML for all kinds of things. So there's a good chance you're already familiar with what's going to happen today. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we continue introducing fundamentals of ML, decision trees and start with some prediction tasks on crime data. You might ask, why are we doing this? Well, a couple of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It ties nicely with how we started this course: do you remember all we learnt about predictive policing in Week 1? So, today it is our turn to make predictions and see how well we can do with the data we have been exploring.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Visualization **AND** machine learning is a powerful combination. A combination that is pretty rare. \n",
    "  - Usually it's the case that people are either good at machine learning or data viz, but not both. \n",
    "  - So what we will be able to do in this class is an unusual combo: We can use ML to understand data and then visualize the outputs of the machine-learning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The plan for today is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In part 1, we go more in depth on fundamentals of machine learning;\n",
    "2. In part 2, we get an introduction to Decision Trees;\n",
    "3. In part 3, we put everything together to predict criminal recidivism."

    "training sets should give pretty similar models (since any two randomly chosen training sets should have pretty similar average values). So we say that it has a low variance. High bias and low variance typically correspond to underfitting. + On the other hand, the degree 9 model fit the training set perfectly. It has very low bias but very high variance (since any two training sets would likely give rise to very different models). This corresponds to overfitting. + If your model has high bias (which means it performs poorly even on your training data) then one thing to try is adding more features. Going from the degree 0 model in “Overfitting and Underfitting” on page 142 to the degree 1 model was a big improvement. + If your model has high variance, then you can similarly remove features. But another solution is to obtain more data (if you can). + Holding model complexity constant, the more data you have, the harder it is to overfit. + On the other hand, more data won’t help with bias. If your model doesn’t use enough features to capture regularities in the data, throwing more data at it won’t help.\" (reading 1 week 6, chapter \"The Bias-Variance Trade-off\")\n",

    "> * Explain in your own words: Why is entropy useful when deciding where to split the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> \"Ideally, we’d like to choose questions whose answers give a lot of information about what our tree should predict. If there’s a single yes/no question for which “yes” answers always correspond to True outputs and “no” answers to False outputs (or vice versa), this would be an awesome question to pick. Conversely, a yes/no question for which neither answer gives you much new information about what the prediction should be is probably not a good choice. We capture this notion of “how much information” with entropy. You have probably heard this used to mean disorder. We use it to represent the uncertainty associated with data. + Imagine that we have a set S of data, each member of which is labeled as belonging to one of a finite number of classes C1, ..., Cn. If all the data points belong to a single class, then there is no real uncertainty, which means we’d like there to be low entropy. If the data points are evenly spread across the classes, there is a lot of uncertainty and we’d like there to be high entropy.\" (reading 2 week 6, chapter \"Entropy\")\n",
    "<br> \"Correspondingly, we’d like some notion of the entropy that results from partitioning a set of data in a certain way. We want a partition to have low entropy if it splits the data into subsets that themselves have low entropy (i.e., are highly certain), and high\n",

    "> * Why are trees prone to overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> \"One problem with this approach is that partitioning by an attribute with many different values will result in a very low entropy due to overfitting. -> e.g. partitioning on social security numbers will produce one-person subsets with zero entropy -> based on social security number, so cannot be generalised beyond the training set\" (reading 2 week 6, chapter \"The Entropy of a Partition\")\n",

    "> * Explain (in your own words) how random forests help prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> \"One way of avoiding overfitting is a technique called random forests, in which we build multiple decision trees and let them vote on how to classify inputs. + Since each tree is built using different data, each tree will be different from every other tree. + A second source of randomness involves changing the way we chose the best_attribute to split on. Rather than looking at all the remaining attributes, we first choose a random subset of them and then split on whichever of those is best.\" (reading 2 week 6, chapter \"Random Forests\")"

    "> *Exercise 3.3:* Build a Decision Tree or a Random Forest. Now we are going to build a Decision Tree (or a Random Forest) classifier that takes as input the features defined above and predicts if a person is going to recommit the crime within two years.\n",
    "> * Split the data in Train/Test sets. You can do this with `train_test_split` in `sklearn`, I used a 70/30 split, but you are free to try different ones. \n",
    ">     * **Note:** create a balanced dataset, that is, **grab an equal number of examples** from each target value.\n",
    ">    * Fit a model to your Train set. A good option is the  `DecisionTreeClassifier` (or even better a [Random Forest](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.08-random-forests.html), here is [another tutorial for Random Forests](https://towardsdatascience.com/random-forest-in-python-24d0893d51c0)).\n",

    ">    * **hint:** Since you have created a balanced dataset, the baseline performance (random guess) is 50%. \n",
    "> * Are your results tied to the specific training data/hyperparameter set you used? Try to perform a `RandomizedSearchCV` and recompute the performance metric above with the hyperparameters found. [Here](https://towardsdatascience.com/hyperparameter-tuning-the-random-forest-in-python-using-scikit-learn-28d2aa77dd74) a nice tutorial for you! And here one on [cross-validation](https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-validation-in-machine-learning-72924a69872f) for those of you who crave for more.\n",
    "> * Visualize the tree. There are different options to do so. The easiest one is to use `plot_tree`, but there are other [options](https://mljar.com/blog/visualize-decision-tree/). If you chose Random Forest, you can visualize a tree as well by extracting a single tree with `model.estimators_[n]` (n is the index of the estimator you want to select).\n",
    "> * Visualize the Feature Importance. What do you observe?\n",
    "> * **(Optional)** If you find yourself with extra time, come back to this exercise and tweak the encoder, model, and variables you use to see if you can improve the performance of the tree. **Note**: It's not 100% given that adding variables will improve your predictive performance."
